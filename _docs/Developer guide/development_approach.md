1. We build open source software. This allows the community to directly review and critique our code and methodologies, and to contribute code for our review.

2. We use open source technology. We look to build on standard, modern technologies that will reduce the operational cost and/or improve the operational performance of models, that have solid support options for enterprise use, and that are free for general use.

3. We are building a full stack development team. Every team member should understand the system and technologies, be able to build and test the system and have a working knowledge of catastrophe modelling.

4. We use the community to drive development. We have direct access to many of the leading practitioners in the catastrophe modelling domain, and we get practical input through feature prioritization, specification and review of working software.

5. We use partnerships to provide scale, for hosting, support and non-core development.
